# Node.js getting started application
The Getting Started tutorial for Node.js uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Node.js app on IBM Cloud; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud.

The Node.js app uses [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com).

The following steps are the general procedure to set up and deploy your app to IBM Cloud. See more detailed instructions in the [Getting started tutorial for Node.js](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-node-js-on-bluemix).

## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
